/**
 * The left column, and why it is one column rather than two panels.
 *
 * These cover the four things the rebuild was for, each of which was a
 * complaint about the old builder rather than a preference:
 *
 * - what starts the flow is visible without going looking for it;
 * - a step can be reached without hunting for its card on the canvas;
 * - a step's problems are next to the fields that fix them, not behind a tab;
 * - no error code reaches the reader.
