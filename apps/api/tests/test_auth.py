"""Authentication and authorization on ``/api/v1/``.

The two properties this file is about:

* **One failure, one answer.** A missing header, a malformed token, an unknown
  key, a revoked key and a key for an archived workspace all produce the same
  401 with the same body. A caller who can tell those apart has an oracle.
* **``@require_permission`` works unchanged.** SPEC §4.2 says
  ``effective_permissions`` is the only protocol, and this API's whole
  authorization story is a nine-line dataclass that exposes it.
