"""Minting and verifying public API keys (SPEC §5 ``api_key``, §17).

The token an integration presents is never stored. What the row holds is a
keyed digest of it plus an indexed, non-secret prefix — CONTRIBUTING.md's rule
for "a credential that arrives in a request", and the same shape
``apps.members.models.Invitation`` uses for invite tokens.

Token format::

    bb_<secret>_<lookup>

``secret``
    43 URL-safe characters from ``secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`` — 256 bits. This
    is the only secret material; everything else in the token is derived from
    it and is safe to store and display.

``lookup``
    The first 8 hex characters of ``sha256(secret)``. Stored in plaintext and
    indexed, so verification is one index hit rather than a table scan of HMACs.
    It is also the handle the settings UI shows for a key whose plaintext is
    long gone.

Why both a lookup prefix and a digest, when a unique index on the digest alone
would find the row: the prefix is what keeps the *comparison* in Python, where
it is ``secrets.compare_digest``. It is deliberately **not** unique — 8 hex
characters is 32 bits, so a birthday collision arrives somewhere around 65k
keys, and a unique index would turn that into a random issuance failure. The
digest carries the uniqueness constraint; the prefix carries the lookup.

The digest is ``apps.common.encryption.hmac_digest``, keyed from ``SECRET_KEY``
rather than a bare hash: an unkeyed digest of a 256-bit token is not guessable,
but keying costs nothing and means a database dump is useless on its own.
