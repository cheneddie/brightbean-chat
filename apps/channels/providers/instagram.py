"""Instagram adapter — Instagram API with Instagram Login (SPEC §6.3).

The second real adapter, and written from ``providers/telegram.py``, whose
docstring says a Layer-5 author "should be able to replace the helpers and keep
the class". That is what happened here: the class below implements SPEC §6.1's
interface and nothing else, while everything that is *about Instagram* — the
entry/change shapes, the Send API bodies, the 1000-**byte** text cap, the
generic template — lives in the small helpers above it, each named for the thing
it converts.

Inherited and deliberately not re-implemented:

* HTTP mechanics, the timeout policy, ``429`` → :class:`RateLimitError` and the
  "never put a URL in an error message" rule — :mod:`apps.channels.providers.base`;
* block downgrading — :func:`apps.channels.downgrade.downgrade`, shared;
* the raw-body ``X-Hub-Signature-256`` check and the entry/change walk shared
  with Messenger — :mod:`apps.channels.providers.meta_common`;
* the OAuth exchange, token storage and refresh — :mod:`apps.channels.instagram_oauth`,
  out of this module on purpose (the layer brief asks for it, and it is the same
  separation ``views_telegram`` keeps from ``providers.telegram``).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why ``me`` and not the account id
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Meta documents ``/<IG_ID>/messages`` and ``/me/messages`` as equivalent. This
module uses ``me`` throughout, because the access token *is* the account: an
``IG_ID`` taken from a stored column can disagree with the token after a
reconnect, and the failure mode of that disagreement is a send to the wrong
account rather than an error. The stored ``external_id`` is still load-bearing —
it is how :meth:`InstagramAdapter.resolve_connection` maps an inbound
``entry[].id`` back to a connection — it is simply not used to address outbound
calls.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rate limits, and why there is no throttle in this file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Same argument as Telegram's, and it is worth repeating rather than
cross-referencing because it is the first thing an adapter author reaches for.
The global limit is the connection's token bucket (``apps.messaging.buckets``),
configured by ``rate_default=8.0`` in :mod:`apps.channels.policy`. The
per-recipient limit is satisfied by the shape of the system: SPEC §9.6
serialises everything one contact does behind a single advisory lock, so two
messages to one thread cannot be in flight at once. A throttle here would be a
sleep held *inside* that lock. When Meta disagrees anyway it answers ``429`` and
the send pipeline reschedules.

Meta's own published ceiling for private replies is 750 per hour per account,
which is an order of magnitude above what one connection's bucket will pass.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Secrets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The access token is the account: anyone holding it can read every DM and send as
the account. It lives encrypted in ``connection.credentials`` and appears at
runtime in exactly one place — an ``Authorization: Bearer`` header, deliberately
rather than the ``access_token`` query parameter Meta also accepts, so it never
reaches a proxy access log. Nothing in this module logs a token or a URL;
``base.request_json`` reports the *host* of a failed call and never the path.

    Three assembly rules, in this order, because Instagram cannot express

    This is the step that makes comment-to-DM work at all, and it is worth
    saying why it is a re-dispatch rather than four direct calls.

    ``apps.messaging.ingest`` deliberately creates no contact for an ordinary
    comment — one viral post would otherwise be a contact-spam amplifier. The
    claimed-comment marker below lets ingest create the contact and consent
    audit needed for routing without pretending the public comment was an
    inbound DM: ``last_inbound_at`` and ``window_expires_at`` stay unset. The
    durable comment claim is what grants exactly one private reply instead.

    Routing then matches the comment trigger a second time — with a contact in
    hand this time — and starts the flow, so the flow's first message *is* the
    private reply, exactly as SPEC §10 words it. The text is carried through the
    queue row precisely so that second match sees what the first one saw.
