"""The adapter interface every platform implements (SPEC §6.1).

    class Adapter:
        capabilities: Capabilities   # static per platform
        def verify_webhook(self, request, connection) -> bool
        def parse_events(self, request, connection) -> list[NormalizedEvent]

That is the whole contract, and it is reproduced above so a Layer-5 author can
check their class against the specification without leaving the file. Modelled
on BrightBean Studio's ``providers/base.py``: an abstract base with the
platform-specific work abstract and the shared HTTP mechanics concrete.

**One addition SPEC §7.1 forces.** Meta-style platforms share a single webhook
URL per deployment and "connection resolved from payload ids", so there is a
step before ``verify_webhook`` that the §6.1 list does not name:
:meth:`resolve_connection`. It defaults to None, which the endpoint treats
exactly like a failed signature check — see ``apps.channels.views_webhooks``.

**No adapter and no outbound call ship in this layer.** The HTTP helper below is
here because contract 4 promises a Layer-5 platform costs "one module and one
registry line", and that is only true if the timeout policy, the 429 handling
and the error mapping already exist and are the same for everyone. It is
exercised by ``tests/test_providers_base.py`` through ``httpx.MockTransport``;
nothing in the webhook path calls it.
