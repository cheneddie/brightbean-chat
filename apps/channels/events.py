"""The normalized event and message schemas (SPEC §7.2).

Two directions, one vocabulary:

``NormalizedEvent``
    What an adapter turns a platform's webhook payload *into*. Everything
    downstream — L3-A's persistence, L4-A's trigger matcher — reads this and
    never the raw provider JSON, so a new platform costs a parser rather than a
    branch in the routing code.

``OutboundMessage``
    What the flow engine renders *once*, abstractly, for every platform. The
    adapter (via :mod:`apps.channels.downgrade`) is what turns it into whatever
    the platform can actually carry.

Everything here is a frozen dataclass with tuple collections. Two reasons, both
learned the hard way elsewhere in this repo: these objects are passed to a chain
of processors (contract 6) that must not be able to mutate each other's input,
and a mutable default on a shared dataclass is a bug that only shows up under
concurrency.

Deliberately Django-free at runtime — ``connection`` is typed through
``TYPE_CHECKING`` — so the downgrade renderer and its table tests never need the
app registry.

    A ``StrEnum`` so ``event.type == "message"`` reads true and the value
    serialises into the event log without a conversion step.

    ``MESSAGE_DELETED`` is the addition, and it is deliberate rather than
    incidental. SPEC §7.2 lists nine types; SPEC §6.3 separately requires
    Instagram's ``message_deletions`` webhook field to be handled ("redact
    message body, keep row with status deleted") and §19 repeats it, so the
    signal has to arrive as *something*. The alternative considered was a
    ``DELIVERY_STATUS`` event carrying ``status="deleted"``, which would mean
    widening ``apps.messaging.ingest.RECEIPT_STATUSES`` and the pure
    ``_next_status`` ladder — both deliberately narrow, and neither is about
    deletion. A deletion is not a rung on the delivery ladder; it is the row
    being retracted. So it gets its own type, and this enum is shared, so the
    addition is called out in the PR that made it (#17, L5-A).

    """SPEC §7.2's payload: "text, attachments, button id, comment id, media ids, ref string".

    Every field is optional and defaulted. Webhook payloads are
    attacker-controlled (SECURITY-BASELINE §2), so an adapter that finds a
    missing or wrongly typed key leaves the field at its default rather than
    raising — one malformed event must not cost the whole delivery.

    ``extra`` is the escape hatch for platform-specific detail a later adapter
    needs (a Telegram chat id, a Meta story id) without widening this class for
    every platform. It is untrusted data like the rest.

    **``attachments`` vs ``media_ids``.** Both carry inbound media and the line
    between them is *who can fetch it*, decided by the adapter at parse time:

    ``attachments``
        Addresses that resolve for **anyone**, with no credential of ours. A
        platform that publishes media on a CDN uses this. They are stored on the
        message body as ``file`` blocks and rendered as links — the reader's own
        browser follows them, and this deployment never does. That is not a
        temporary restriction: fetching a stranger's URL server-side is what
        SECURITY-BASELINE §6's guard exists for, and there is no reason to fetch
        something the reader can already reach.

    ``media_ids``
        Identifiers that need **this connection's credentials** to become bytes
        — a Telegram ``file_id``, a Twilio ``MediaUrl`` under an account with
        authenticated media. Storing the identifier rather than a URL is the
        honest record of that, and :mod:`apps.channels.media` is the one path
        that resolves one: the adapter says where and with what headers, the
        shared fetch goes through the SSRF guard, and the bytes are served back
        from our own origin under SECURITY-BASELINE §9.

    An adapter picks one. A platform whose media URL needs a signature, a
    session or an account credential is ``media_ids``, whatever it looks like.
