"""The static per-platform capability table (SPEC §6.1, ROADMAP contract 4).

**This module imports no adapter code and touches no database.** That is the
whole point of it: ROADMAP contract 4 requires the capability table to ship "as
data so L2-D's validation can read it without importing adapter code". The flow
builder (#6/#10) needs to warn that a three-button card will arrive on WhatsApp
as numbered text long before any adapter exists, and an import that dragged in
``providers/`` would make that a circular dependency the first time an adapter
needed to look at a flow.

So: `apps.common.platforms` and the standard library. Nothing else, ever.

The numbers are platform limits, not preferences. Each one carries the reason it
is what it is, because the failure mode of a wrong limit is silent — a message
that the platform rejects at send time, in production, on somebody else's
account. Where a platform documents no hard cap, the comment says so and the
value is a usability choice.

:data:`Capabilities.window_hours` and :data:`Capabilities.broadcast_allowed`
also appear on :class:`~apps.channels.policy.PlatformPolicy`. The policy is
authoritative — it is what the compliance engine (L3-A) reads — and these copies
exist because SPEC §6.1 puts them in the capability list that the builder shows.
``apps/channels/tests/test_registry.py`` asserts the two never drift.
