"""Instagram's OAuth dance and token lifecycle (SPEC §6.3, SECURITY-BASELINE §§4, 5).

Deliberately **not** in ``apps.channels.providers.instagram``. The layer-5 brief
is explicit — "keep the credential exchange out of the adapter module proper" —
and the reason is the same one that keeps ``views_telegram`` out of
``providers/telegram``: the adapter is the thing five more platforms copy, and
an OAuth round trip is not part of what they are copying. What lives here is
everything that mints, stores, refreshes or invalidates the credential; the
adapter imports :func:`access_token` and nothing else.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ``state`` parameter is a CSRF token, so it is a signed one
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Without it, anyone who can make an operator's browser hit the callback with a
code of *their* choosing connects **their** Instagram account into the
operator's workspace — every DM to that account then lands in a stranger's
inbox. So ``state`` is minted with :mod:`apps.common.signing`, which
SECURITY-BASELINE §4 makes the one implementation for token-bearing routes, and
it carries the workspace *and* the user it was minted for. The callback checks
both: a state signed for another workspace, another user, or more than
``STATE_MAX_AGE`` ago is refused before a single byte is exchanged with Meta.

``purpose`` is the signer salt, so a state token cannot be replayed against the
unsubscribe route or the tick endpoint even though all three share ``SECRET_KEY``.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three tokens, one stored
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Meta hands out a short-lived token (1 hour) which is exchanged for a long-lived
one (60 days) which is refreshed for another 60. Only the long-lived token is
ever written to ``connection.credentials``; the short-lived one exists for the
two seconds between the two calls. ``token_expires_at`` is stored beside it so
:func:`refresh_expiring_tokens` can find the connections that need attention
without asking Meta about every account every hour.

A refresh that fails is not a transient error to swallow: the account stops
working in at most 60 days and nobody finds out. It flips the connection to
``needs_reauth`` and raises the ``channel_needs_reauth`` notification, which is
the state the reconnect button clears.

Nothing here logs a token, and nothing renders one. ``request_json`` reports the
host of a failed call and never the path, which matters more than usual on this
module: Meta's token endpoints take credentials in the query string.
