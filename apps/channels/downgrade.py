"""Deterministic block downgrading (SPEC §6.1).

    The engine renders one abstract ``OutboundMessage``; the adapter downgrades
    unsupported blocks deterministically: gallery -> sequential image+text
    messages; buttons unsupported -> numbered options appended to text ("Reply 1
    for ..."); card -> image + text + url in text.

This module is that renderer, written once rather than once per adapter — six
implementations of "approximately this" is six subtly different products.

**Pure by construction.** No Django import, no database, no clock, no
randomness, no I/O. Same input, same output, forever; which is what lets
``tests/test_downgrade.py`` be a table, and what lets L2-D's builder preview a
downgrade at edit time with no connection in existence.

**Idempotent.** Downgrading an already-downgraded message returns it unchanged.
The renderer sits on the send path, and a retry that re-rendered would otherwise
renumber the options a contact is still looking at.

Numbering runs **continuously across the whole result**, not per message. A
three-card gallery whose cards each carry a button becomes three messages, and
if each restarted at 1 a contact replying "1" would be answering an ambiguous
question. The mapping returned here is the answer key L4-A matches a numeric
reply against.

The order of operations is fixed, and is the order below — galleries expand
before cards downgrade, cards before media, media before buttons, buttons before
the length cap — because every step can create work for the next.
