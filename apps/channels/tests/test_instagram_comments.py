"""Comment to DM, end to end — SPEC §10's headline Instagram feature.

    Comment trigger behavior: public reply and like are executed via the platform
    API, the private reply (the flow's first message) counts against the
    one-private-reply-per-comment rule; store handled comment ids to enforce
    once_per_contact_per_post and the 7-day private-reply deadline.

Everything between the two ends is the production path: the webhook endpoint,
signature verification, deduplication, the contract-6 seam, L3-A's persistence
and compliance and token bucket, L4-A's routing stages and comment guard, L3-B's
engine, and this adapter. The only substitution is the network.

The four assertions the issue names are :class:`TestCommentToDm` below; the ones
about *not* doing something are the ones worth reading twice.
