"""The edge handle grammar from SPEC §9.1.

An edge's ``sourceHandle`` says *which way out* of a node it is:

    default | btn:<id> | qr:<id> | cond:true | cond:false | rand:<id> | timeout | error

The runner (L3-B) follows the edge whose handle the node returned, so a handle
this module cannot parse is a route that can never be taken. Validation rejects
it rather than letting it sit in a published graph as a silent dead end.

Which handles a *particular* node exposes depends on its type and, for the
dynamic ones, on its config — a ``btn:<id>`` is only real if a button with that
id exists. That question needs the node registry, so it lives in
:func:`apps.flows.schema.nodes.handles_for_node`; this module owns the grammar
alone and imports nothing from the registry.
