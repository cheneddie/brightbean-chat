"""SPEC §10's trigger vocabulary, as data rather than as branches.

Two tables and nothing else. The first is the type enum, which
:class:`apps.flows.models.Trigger` stores; the second answers "which platforms
can this type ever fire on", which SPEC §10 writes as a "Channels" column and
which three separate consumers need:

* the matcher, to decide whether an unbound trigger (``channel_connection`` is
  null, meaning "all connections of a matching platform") applies to the
  connection an event arrived on;
* ``Trigger.clean()``, to refuse a binding that could never match — an
  Instagram-only trigger pointed at an SMS connection is a data error, not a
  row that silently never fires;
* :func:`apps.flows.triggers.services.platforms_for_flow`, which recomputes the
  §16 capability warnings from what a flow is actually triggered on.

Writing it once as a dict is what keeps those three from disagreeing.

**This module imports nothing from ``apps.flows``**, deliberately:
``apps.flows.models`` imports it, so anything it imported back would be a cycle.
