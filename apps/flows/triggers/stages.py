"""The hooks this issue registers into contract 6's stages.

Four of the five stages get one hook each; ``post_persist`` ships **empty and
named**, which is the point of it — L6-C's inbox rules go there, and the stage
existing and being tested now is what lets that be a registration rather than an
edit to routing code.

Read this file before writing a hook of your own: it is the working example the
layer prompt points L5-D and L6-C at.

One thing L5-D specifically needs to know. A ``hard_optout`` hook **cannot write
``identity.opted_out_at``** — contract 3 gives that column one write site,
``apps/messaging/ingest.py``, and ``apps/messaging/tests/test_write_sites.py``
fails the build over it. Ingest already applies it from an ``EventType.OPT_OUT``
event, so an SMS adapter's job is to classify ``STOP``/``UNSUBSCRIBE`` as that
event type in ``parse_events``; the hook then owns the confirmation reply and
consuming the event, which is what :func:`opt_out_event` below does for the
platform-agnostic half.
