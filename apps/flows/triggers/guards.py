"""The two durable guards SPEC §10 asks for: the 24-hour default reply, and comments.

Both are "may I do this once" questions answered by the database rather than by
a read followed by a write, because both are asked concurrently. Two events from
one contact arrive in a single delivery and
:func:`apps.messaging.ingest.persist_events` gives each its own transaction, so
a ``SELECT`` then ``INSERT`` lets both through — every time, not rarely.
