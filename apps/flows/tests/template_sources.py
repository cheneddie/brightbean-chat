"""The shipped templates, as Python definitions the real exporter turns into JSON.

``flow-templates/*.json`` is checked byte-for-byte against
``serialize(export_document(imported_flow))`` by
:mod:`apps.flows.tests.test_portability_library`. That is a strong guarantee and
an unforgiving one: a hand-written file has to independently rediscover every
convention of :mod:`apps.flows.portability.export` — manifest entries in
first-appearance walk order, an entry keyed by its ref when something addresses
it by id and by its case-folded name otherwise, the ``detail`` a custom field
carries, ``folder`` emitted even when empty, a comment trigger's ``post_ids``
emptied rather than removed. Across a library this size that is a few hundred
hand-maintained manifest rows, each of which must agree with a machine's walk
order.

So the graph and the triggers are written here, where they are readable and
reviewable, and **the envelope is generated**. The exporter is the only thing
that gets the mechanical part right by construction, and using it means the
library cannot drift from the format the importer accepts.

Regenerate with::

    BRIGHTBEAN_REGENERATE_TEMPLATES=1 pytest apps/flows/tests/test_template_library_sources.py

which makes ``flow-templates/*.json`` a build artifact with a staleness gate, the
same arrangement ``static/flows/flow-schema.json`` has with
``export_flow_schema --check``.

**Not** a management command: this needs a database and a throwaway workspace, so
a command shipped to every self-hoster would write rows into *their* database and
files into a source tree they do not have. ``validate_flow_templates`` already
covers the contributor-facing need.
