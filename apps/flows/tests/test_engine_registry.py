"""ROADMAP contract 5, and the agreement between runtime and schema.

Two registries, two apps, one node type. The tests here are mostly about the
*seam*: a runtime whose type no schema describes can never run, and a schema
whose type no runtime claims cannot either. Both are legal states of a layered
build — the second one is the normal state — so the point is to make each a
deliberate, visible fact rather than something noticed in production.

#: Pinned so a type joining or leaving the set is a line in a diff.
#: ``external_request`` left it in L4-E, ``send_sms`` in L5-D (#20) and

#: randomizer, start flow". ``note`` joins it for free — it does nothing.

#: ``smart_delay`` and ``data_collection`` are deliberately *absent*: SPEC names
#: the safe five and neither is one of them. Nothing is lost by enqueueing them
#: — a delay is not the first reply a webhook is racing to produce, and a
#: question sends and then parks.
