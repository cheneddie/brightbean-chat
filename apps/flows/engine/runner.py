"""The runner loop: SPEC §9.2's state machine, §9.6's lock, §9.5's failure policy.

    The runner loop: load execution (locked, 9.6), dispatch current node, follow
    edge for the returned handle, increment blocks_since_pause, repeat. Missing
    edge for a handle -> End. […] If it reaches 30 -> Fail("loop cap"), notify
    workspace admins (in-app notification), status failed.

Three properties this module is built around, in order of how badly they break
things when they are wrong.

**One step at a time per contact.** SPEC §3 calls it the "single invariant that
everything relies on". Every public entry point here opens ``transaction.atomic()``
and takes ``apps.queueing.locks.contact_lock`` before it reads the execution, and
nothing in this app advances an execution any other way. Advisory locks are
counted per session, so the worker having already taken the same lock (it does —
``apps.queueing.worker.process_action``) makes the second acquisition free rather
than a deadlock, which is what lets these functions be honest about their own
requirements instead of trusting a caller to have done it.

**That lock blocks, and the inline path must not.** SPEC §9.6: "Inline path:
``pg_try_advisory_xact_lock``; if unavailable, enqueue instead of blocking the
web request." Calling :func:`start_flow` or
:func:`apps.flows.engine.waits.attempt_resume` straight from a webhook request
would hold a gunicorn thread behind whatever the worker is doing to that
contact. The counted-lock property above is what makes the fix two lines rather
than a second set of entry points — take the non-blocking lock first, and the
engine's own acquisition inside it is then free::

    with transaction.atomic(), try_contact_lock(contact) as acquired:
        if not acquired:
            schedule(ActionType.RESUME_EXECUTION, timezone.now(), ..., contact=contact)
            return
        attempt_resume(execution, event)

The worker needs none of this: it has no client on the other end of the socket
and is expected to wait.

**The runner owns every write to the execution row.** Nodes report through
:mod:`apps.flows.engine.results` and never save. That is the reason status can be
reasoned about at all: there is exactly one function per terminal state, each
called from one place.

**Unknown exceptions are not caught here.** A node that raises rolls the whole
transaction back — its own half-finished writes included — and the queue retries
it on SPEC §15's backoff ladder. Catching and marking the execution ``failed``
would do the opposite: it would *commit* the partial writes of the node that just
blew up, in the same transaction, and call the run cleanly dead. So a node
converts the failures it can *diagnose* into ``Fail`` (a filter that no longer
validates, a target flow that has been deleted) and lets everything else
propagate. The inline path's "any error: enqueue" (SPEC §7.1) is L4-A's catch,
not this module's.
