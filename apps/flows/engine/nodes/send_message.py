"""SPEC §11.1 — render one abstract message and hand it to contract 1.

    Behavior: renders per capability flags; if buttons/QRs present -> Wait, else
    Continue(default).

The node renders **once**, abstractly, into an ``OutboundMessage``; the adapter
(via ``apps.channels.downgrade``) is what turns that into whatever the platform
can carry. Nothing here branches on a platform, and nothing here builds a
provider payload.

Three rules do the work, and each one is somebody else's decision this node is
obeying:

* **Every author string goes through the shared renderer** (SECURITY-BASELINE
  §3). Block text, captions, card titles, button labels, URLs — all of it, via
  ``ctx.render``, which is plain token substitution with no template engine
  anywhere near it.
* **Media resolves through the library**, ``media_library.resolution.resolve``
  with its required ``workspace`` kwarg. That module's docstring already decided
  what a missing asset means: "a deleted image stops the message, not the flow."
* **A failed send follows ``default``** (SPEC §9.5). The message row carries the
  reason; the run continues. It does *not* then wait for buttons the contact
  never saw — a wait for a reply to a message that was never delivered is a
  contact parked until the 30-day sweep.

    Still not a platform branch. The key is optional config that a *builder*
    only offers for a WhatsApp-targeted flow, and what it produces —
    ``template_ref`` plus ``template_variables`` — is the platform-neutral pair
    :class:`~apps.channels.events.OutboundMessage` already carries for exactly
    this purpose. An adapter with no templates simply ignores both, and
    ``compliance.can_send`` reads ``template_ref`` as data (SPEC §8's
    ``TEMPLATE_SUPPLIED``) without knowing which platform supplied it.

    **The reference is re-derived from the row, against the connection this run
    is on.** Trusting the one the builder wrote is not safe: a template name is
    scoped to a WhatsApp Business Account, so a flow that can run on two numbers
    can carry a reference the second one does not have — and if that second WABA
    holds a same-named template, Meta sends its words instead, to a real
    contact, with nothing reporting a problem. ``whatsapp_templates.sendable``
    is the check.

    **Its rendered copy becomes the message body.** The adapter puts only the
    template on the wire, so storing the node's own blocks would leave the inbox
    showing a conversation that did not happen.

    Failing to resolve is deliberate and quiet-ish: no reference is supplied, so
    outside the window ``can_send`` refuses with ``needs_template`` and the node
    follows ``default`` with the reason on the row (SPEC §8), while inside it the
    author's own blocks still go. Both are better than sending words nobody
    approved.

    **The values are rendered here**, through ``ctx.render``, and that placement
    is the security property: a template slot is filled with contact data, and
    the substitution has to happen where the one shared renderer is
    (SECURITY-BASELINE §3). By the time the adapter sees these pairs they are
    finished strings, and its docstring says it must never render them again.
