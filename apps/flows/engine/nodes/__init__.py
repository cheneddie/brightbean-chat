"""Importing this package registers every node runtime this layer ships.

Registration is an import side effect — the same pattern
:mod:`apps.queueing.registry` documents for handlers — so ``FlowsConfig.ready()``
importing this package is the whole wiring. A node module that is never imported
is a node type the engine reports as having no runtime, which is exactly the
right symptom for a module somebody forgot to list here.

``send_sms`` arrived with L5-D (#20) and lives here rather than in the SMS
adapter's own app for the reason ``external_request`` does: ``apps.channels``
sits *below* the engine, so a node registered from there would be an upward
import. ``send_email`` is L5-E's and is still to come.
