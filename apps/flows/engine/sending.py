"""The one place a node hands a message to ROADMAP contract 1.

Three nodes and one resume path send messages — ``send_message``,
``data_collection``'s question, the retry text on an unmatched reply — and all
four need the same four things right: the idempotency key SPEC §9.4 specifies,
the connection SPEC §9.3 says the run is happening on, the source string
compliance keys off, and SPEC §9.5's rule about what a failed send means.

    Node-level provider errors: 4xx permanent -> message failed, follow
    ``default`` edge onward (sending failure does not kill the flow) […]

So the send lives here rather than in the send node, and the other three call
into it instead of reimplementing three quarters of it.

**A failed send is not a failed run.** :func:`deliver` returns the outcome; it
never raises for a compliance denial or a provider 4xx, because contract 1 is
explicit that those come back as a ``Message`` with ``status="failed"`` and a
machine-readable code. What *does* propagate is the facade being absent (a
deployment problem, turned into a named ``Fail`` by the caller) and anything
unexpected (rolled back and retried by the queue).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The envelope: what the run's *starter* contributes to the send
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two fields of an outbound message are decided by whoever started the run rather
than by the flow author, and neither can be reconstructed from a node's config.

``source``. SPEC §5 fixes the vocabulary at ``automation, agent, api, broadcast,
sequence``, and ``started_by`` is the only thing that knows which of the last two
a run is: a broadcast's one-shot flow start stamps ``broadcast:<id>``, a
sequence step ``sequence:<id>``. Recording every one of them as ``automation``
would put a broadcast's messages in the inbox under the wrong label and hide them
from L7-A's counters, and it would bypass ``PlatformPolicy.broadcast_allowed``,
which SPEC §8 gates on exactly this value.

``tag``. SPEC §6.4 lets a Messenger send outside the 24-hour window carry a
non-promotional message tag, and SPEC §13.1 makes choosing one the broadcast
composer's job. The compliance engine already reads ``outbound.tag`` — its
``_outside_window_code`` grants ``tag_supplied`` for a tag in the platform's own
``PlatformPolicy.outside_window.tags`` — so the only piece missing was a way for
the starter to supply one. It travels in :data:`ENVELOPE_TAG_VAR`, a reserved
execution variable.

**Why that is not a hole.** The envelope is read only for a run whose
``started_by`` kind is ``broadcast``, so a variable a flow author collects — a
``data_collection`` field, an External Request mapping — can never reach it. And
the tag is still policy-validated downstream: ``HUMAN_AGENT`` is not in
Messenger's tag tuple, and ``can_send`` grants the human-agent allowance only to
``source="agent"`` (SPEC §22, hard-coded), so nothing here buys the seven-day
escape.
