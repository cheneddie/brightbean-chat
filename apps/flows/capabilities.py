"""Per-platform channel capabilities — ROADMAP contract 4's consumer side.

Validation emits *warnings* when a graph asks a channel for something it cannot
do: buttons on SMS, a gallery on WhatsApp, 3000 characters where the platform
takes 1000. Contract 4 is explicit that this must read **registry data, never
adapter code** — "so L2-D's validation can emit capability warnings without
importing adapter code and Layer 5 adapters never patch can_send". Importing
``channels.providers`` here would also be an import cycle waiting to happen, and
would drag HTTP clients into a code path that only ever asks a table a question.

This module is the single swap point, in the same shape as
:mod:`apps.flows.schema.condition`: the import wins as soon as
``apps.channels`` exists, and the table below is SPEC §6.1's field list filled in
from §§6.2–6.7 until then. ``apps.channels`` has since shipped, so on this
deployment the import takes and :data:`CAPABILITIES_ARE_VENDORED` is False — the
table below is the fallback for a build without that app, not what is in force.
A test asserts that, so the two cannot quietly swap places again.

The values are conservative by design. A missing warning is a surprise at
runtime; a spurious one is a line in a panel that publishes anyway, since
capability findings never block (SPEC §9.1: "channel-capability warnings
(non-blocking)").
