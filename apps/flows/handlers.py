"""The three queue action types the engine owns (SPEC §5, §9.3, §15).

``start_flow``, ``resume_execution`` and ``followup_timer`` — the names
``apps.queueing.models.ActionType`` already reserves for this issue. Registration
is an import side effect of ``FlowsConfig.ready()``, which is the pattern
:mod:`apps.queueing.registry`'s docstring writes out.

Three things the queue guarantees, so nothing here re-does them:

* the handler runs **inside a transaction that already holds the contact
  advisory lock** when the row names a contact (``apps.queueing.worker``). The
  engine takes the lock again anyway — advisory locks are counted per session,
  so it is free — because the engine's entry points must be correct when called
  from the inline path too;
* raising retries the row on SPEC §15's backoff ladder, up to ``max_attempts``;
* returning normally marks it done, in the same transaction as the work.

Which is why the interesting decision in this module is the *opposite* of
raising. A trigger can name a flow somebody has since unpublished, and a timer
can fire for an execution a reply already resumed. Neither is retriable: five
attempts over six hours cannot make an unpublished flow publishable, and the
row's ``last_error`` would file a normal race under "failed". So
:class:`~apps.flows.engine.FlowNotRunnableError` and a missing execution are
logged and swallowed; everything else propagates.
