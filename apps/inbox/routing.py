"""The inbox's hook at contract 6's ``post_persist`` stage (SPEC §14).

The stage was built for this and shipped empty. ``apps/flows/triggers/stages.py``
says so — "``post_persist`` ships **empty and named**, which is the point of it"
— so everything below is a *registration*. Nothing in ``apps.flows`` changes, and
this module is the only thing in the product that knows inbox rules exist.

Four properties of the stage that this module is written around.

**It runs while automation is paused, and there is no pause check here.**
``RUNS_WHILE_PAUSED`` contains ``post_persist`` structurally, because "labels and
assignment are inbox features and suppressing those during a takeover would break
the takeover". Adding a check would re-implement, wrongly, a decision the router
already made.

**It never consumes the event.** A rule is not a trigger: SPEC §14 evaluates
*every* rule and applies them cumulatively, so there is no "first match wins" and
nothing here may stop the chain. :func:`apply_inbox_rules` returns ``None``,
which ``hooks.HookOutcome`` reads as ``Passed`` for exactly this case. In
particular a rule that marks a thread done does **not** block trigger matching —
and the more surprising half of that is documented on :func:`_mark_done`.

**It runs twice in two different worlds.** Inline it is outside any transaction
of ours and holds no lock, so each write below commits on its own. On the worker
— a replay after any hook at this stage defers — ``queueing.worker.process_action``
has already opened a transaction *and* taken the contact advisory lock, so the
same code runs as one atomic unit inside a savepoint. Both are correct; neither
is assumed.

**Which is why every rule claims before it acts.** ``InboxRuleApplication`` is
the ledger, and its unique constraint is what makes a replay a no-op. Guarding
each action separately instead would be three idempotency stories that can each
be wrong on their own.

    thread, the contact replies, and the rule hands it straight back to whoever
    the rule names. Assigning only an unassigned thread is both what a helpdesk
    wants and what makes the action idempotent under replay.

    **Reading first is not enough.** ``apps/flows/triggers/pipeline.py`` runs
    this stage without the contact lock on purpose, so between a bare read and
    the write an agent can claim the thread from the inbox and the rule
    overwrites them — the exact outcome the guard exists to prevent, in a window
    the guard itself creates. That module names the remedy: "If a rule of yours
    needs the lock, take it yourself, in your own transaction, via
    ``apps.queueing.locks.contact_lock``." This is the one action that does.

    ``try_contact_lock`` rather than the blocking one, because inline this is a
    webhook request and SPEC §9.6 is explicit that it must not wait behind
    whatever the worker is doing to this contact. Contention means a flow step is
    in flight for the same person; the rule's other actions have already applied,
    and skipping the assignment is a better answer than either blocking the ack
    or stealing a thread. On the worker path the lock is already held by
    ``process_action`` and advisory locks are re-entrant per session, so this
    always acquires and costs nothing.
