"""The inbox's own state: read cursors, labels, rules, and deferred work.

Everything the inbox *shows* about a conversation lives in ``apps.messaging`` and
is read-only here — ROADMAP contract 1 makes ``messaging/services.py`` the only
way to mutate a conversation or a message, and contract 3 makes
``automation_paused_until`` messaging's to write. What messaging does *not* have
is any notion of who has read what, which threads carry which labels, what an
operator asked to be reminded about, or what they queued to send later.

So all of that lives here, in the app that needs it. These are the inbox's own
bookkeeping about its own operators rather than tenant-visible conversation
state, which is why adding them does not cross the facade boundary. SPEC §5
groups ``conversation_label`` and ``inbox_rule`` under its *messaging* heading;
that section is a data-model sketch, not an app assignment, and putting them here
keeps every migration this issue ships inside an app no sibling workstream
touches.

Two rules the rows below all obey.

*Workspace is derived, never set by a caller.* ``ConversationScopedModel`` takes
it from the conversation and checks the peer foreign key against the same
workspace, for the reason ``apps.contacts.models.ContactScopedModel`` spells out
at length: ``link.workspace``, ``link.conversation.workspace`` and
``link.label.workspace`` are three separate answers to "whose row is this?", and
a form field naming another tenant's label is an IDOR no URL fuzzer reaches.

*Deferred work is cancelled by status, never deleted.* The thread's ETag is a
``Max(updated_at)`` and a ``Count(id)`` over these tables (``apps.inbox.selectors``),
and a ``Max`` cannot see a row that is gone.

    **Compliance is re-decided when it fires, never at compose time.** A window
    can close in the hours between; the send goes through
    ``apps.messaging.services.send_as_agent``, which is the chokepoint, and a
    refusal comes back as a failed ``Message`` that this row records and
    surfaces. Nothing is silently dropped.
