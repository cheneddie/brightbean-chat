"""Every read the inbox performs. No writes live here.

Two things in this module are load-bearing and easy to get subtly wrong:

**Unread.** ``Conversation.last_message_at`` moves for *any* message — the
agent's own reply and an internal note included — so "last_message_at is newer
than my cursor" would light the badge the instant an agent answered. The
question SPEC §14 is actually asking is whether the *contact* has said something
since this member last looked, so :func:`with_unread` tests for an inbound
message newer than the cursor and nothing else. That is also what the issue
means by keeping notes out of the contact-visible counts.

**The version tokens.** The pollers need a value that changes when, and only
when, the rendered markup would, and the two surfaces reach that differently.

:func:`conversation_version` aggregates, because a thread's markup follows its
message rows. ``Max("updated_at")`` alone is not enough: delete the most
recently touched row and the maximum walks *backwards* to a value the client is
already holding, so the stale render survives the change that removed it.
Pairing it with ``Count("id")`` closes that.

:func:`list_version` hashes the values the rows are about to print instead. An
aggregate over conversations kept missing changes that live somewhere else — a
refused send writes a message without touching the conversation, a rename moves
a contact — and each miss was a client stuck on a 304 for ever. Hashing the
render inputs makes the token right by construction rather than right as long
as somebody remembers to add the next input to it.
