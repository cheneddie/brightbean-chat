"""The ``send_retry`` queue handler (SPEC §9.5).

    Node-level provider errors: 4xx permanent -> message failed [...] 429/5xx ->
    schedule send_retry with backoff 30s, 2m, 10m, 1h, 6h then failed.

Those five numbers are **not restated here**. They are
``apps.queueing.worker.BACKOFF_SCHEDULE``, and the ladder is walked through
``next_run_at`` — one definition, one place to change it, and no chance of this
app and the worker disagreeing about what "then failed" means.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why the retry budget lives on the message
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

``ScheduledAction.attempts`` counts attempts *of the action*, and the first send
is inline with no action row at all — so an action-based budget is off by one
from birth, and a message whose first attempt failed inline would get one more
retry than one whose first attempt was itself a retry. ``Message.send_attempts``
counts provider calls, which is the thing SPEC §9.5 is actually bounding.

It also makes the handler safe to re-run: zombie recovery can re-run an action
whose handler committed, and a budget already spent means this returns rather
than calling anyone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why the retry re-checks compliance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Six hours is the last rung of the ladder, and a 24-hour messaging window can
close inside it. This is the compliance chokepoint (SPEC §19); a retry that
skipped it would be the one path in the product that sends outside a window
without asking.

    The counterpart to :func:`schedule_send_retry`, and it lives beside it
    because the ladder is one thing: the module that arms a rung is the module
    that knows how to find it again. Returns how many rows were cancelled.

    ``pending`` only, matching ``apps.flows.engine.runner._supersede`` and
    ``apps.contacts.activity.stand_down``. Cancelling a ``running`` row would
    not recall the handler already inside it, and does not need to: that handler
    re-reads ``message.status`` before it does anything and returns on anything
    but ``queued``, with ``services._claim``'s compare-and-set behind it as the
    last word. So the message's status is the authority on whether a send
    happens and this is the optimisation that stops a worker waking up to
    rediscover it.

    Matched on ``contact_id`` as well as the payload. The payload is the precise
    predicate — ``schedule_send_retry`` writes ``{"message_id": ...}`` and JSONB
    carries no index here — but every ``send_retry`` also names the contact, and
    that column *is* indexed with ``status``. Cancelling a broadcast withdraws a
    row per recipient, and one narrow index scan each is the difference between
    that being linear and being a scan of the whole pending backlog per message.

    Goes through :func:`apps.queueing.registry.cancel_pending`, the disarm-side
    counterpart to :func:`~apps.queueing.registry.schedule` this function's own
    docstring already promises: the mechanics of "what pending means and how to
    cancel it" belong to the queue, not to every app that arms work on it.
