"""The compliance engine — SPEC §8's single chokepoint.

    ``can_send(identity, source, outbound) -> Allowed | NeedsTemplate(reason) |
    NeedsTag(allowed_tags) | Blocked(reason)``. Called by the send pipeline for
    every outbound message, no exceptions.

SPEC §19 puts opt-out enforcement here "and not in flows, so it cannot be
bypassed", which is what makes this module worth its length.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
No per-platform branches, and how that is kept true
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not one platform name appears below. Every decision reads a field of
``apps.channels.policy.PlatformPolicy`` — ``window_hours``, ``outside_window``,
``human_agent_days``, ``broadcast_allowed`` — which is contract 4's promise that
a Layer-5 platform costs "one module and one registry line". An adapter adds a
policy row; it never patches this file.

``has_window()`` is consulted **before** ``outside_window``, which
``apps.channels.policy``'s own docstring says is load-bearing: the literal is
populated for Telegram, SMS and email even though it is unreachable there, so a
consumer that read it without checking would refuse every windowless send.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
One rule list, two evaluators
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPEC §13.2 needs the same rules applied *set-wise* before a broadcast fans out,
and two implementations of a compliance rule is two chances to disagree — with
the failure mode being a broadcast whose preview count includes people the send
then refuses, or worse, does not.

So :func:`_rules` returns an ordered list in which each rule carries **both**
spellings of the same predicate: a ``Q`` for the database and a callable for
Python. ``can_send`` walks it; :func:`annotate_eligibility` compiles the same
list — the same objects, built once — into a ``Case``/``When``, which evaluates
top-down in exactly the same order. Ordering, the broadcast short-circuit, the
window short-circuit and the outside-window answer are therefore literally
shared, and the only thing that can drift is one rule's two spellings.
``test_compliance_setwise.py`` closes that by asserting the two agree row by row
for every platform and source.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The tag is ours, not the caller's
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

:meth:`Allowed.apply` **replaces** ``outbound.tag`` rather than passing the
caller's through. That is a security property: SPEC §22 says the human-agent
allowance is "available only to inbox sends, never automation, hard-coded", and
without this an automation node could set ``tag="HUMAN_AGENT"`` and buy itself
the seven-day escape.
