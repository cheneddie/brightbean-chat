"""Inbound persistence — ROADMAP contract 6's second stage (SPEC §7.1 step 3).

``apps.channels`` verifies a delivery, dedups it against ``webhook_event_log``,
persists the raw payload and then hands each surviving :class:`NormalizedEvent`
to the processors registered on its seam. This module is the first of those
processors. It turns an event into rows:

    identity → contact → conversation → message, then the bookkeeping

and it is the **only** place ``identity.window_expires_at`` is ever assigned
(SPEC §8: "updated on every inbound event in the webhook path. Nowhere else.").
``apps/messaging/tests/test_write_sites.py`` asserts that by scanning the source
tree, because a second write site would be a messaging window that reopens
itself — invisible in review, and a compliance failure rather than a bug.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why each event gets its own transaction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

``process_events`` calls processors **outside** a transaction, and a Meta batch
carries several unrelated events for several unrelated people. One event that
cannot be persisted — a payload shape no adapter anticipated, a contact row that
lost a race — must not roll back its siblings, so the atomic block and the
``except`` are both per event. The seam already isolates *processors* from each
other; this isolates events from each other inside one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which event types produce what
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

=====================  ==========  ========  ======  ==================

Four of those rows are decisions rather than transcription.

*A window opens only for an event the contact authored.* A story mention or an
m.me / ``?start=`` referral is the contact opening a conversation, so it opens
the window — SPEC §10's Ref URL and Welcome triggers depend on that, and a
welcome message that cannot be sent is a broken headline feature. A **follow**
is not: following a page is a relationship, not a message, and it carries no
consent to message back. Its identity is created with ``opt_in=False``, so
L5-A's follow trigger has something to match while compliance still refuses to
send.

*Activity events write no message row.* They are contact activity and a trigger
matches on them, but writing one into the thread would show an agent a
conversation the contact never had, and float an empty thread to the top of an
inbox sorted by ``last_message_at``.

*A comment writes nothing at all* — **unless it has been claimed.** A comment is
public, not a DM, and creating a contact per comment turns one viral post into a
contact-spam amplifier, so an ordinary comment event is ignored here. L4-A owns
the platform-agnostic comment infrastructure and reads the event off this same
seam.

The exception is the one case where the platform genuinely permits us to write
to the person: a comment that SPEC §10's once-per-comment guard has already
claimed, which an adapter re-dispatches carrying
:data:`PRIVATE_REPLY_CLAIMED_KEY`. That marker is why the amplifier stays shut —
a claim is once per comment and once per commenter per post, so the identity
count is bounded by the guard rather than by how viral the post went. Such an
event gets an identity and a consent record stamped ``OptInSource.COMMENT``,
but **no normal messaging window** and no ``last_inbound_at``: a public
comment is not an inbound DM. The one private reply is authorized separately by
the durable comment claim carried into the flow. It still writes **no** message
row: their comment is not a DM they sent us.

*A deletion redacts rather than removes.* SPEC §6.3 and §19 both require
Instagram's ``message_deletions`` to "redact message body, keep row with status
deleted". The row keeps its place in the thread and its timestamps; the body is
replaced with a marker the inbox renders as a tombstone. It is matched on
``provider_message_id`` in **either** direction, because a contact can delete
their own message as easily as we can delete ours.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The clock is ours, not the platform's
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

``window_expires_at`` is computed from ``timezone.now()``, never from
``event.timestamp``. A platform timestamp is attacker-adjacent — it arrives
inside a signed-but-not-trusted payload — and letting it set the window means a
forged future timestamp buys an arbitrarily long right to send.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Delivery receipts and ``payload.extra``
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

``EventPayload`` has no field for "the provider message id this receipt refers
to", and widening it would mean editing another workstream's shipped app. So the
convention lives here, in the module that reads it, and Layer-5 adapters
populate ``payload.extra``:

    ``{"provider_message_id": "<id>", "status": "sent|delivered|read|failed",
    "error": "<machine-readable code, optional>"}``

Anything else is ignored rather than raised on: a receipt for a message this
deployment never sent is normal (a shared page, a restored backup), not an
error.

Two more keys travel the same way, for the same reason, and are read only here:

``provider_message_id`` on a **message** event
    The platform's own id for an *inbound* message. Optional — Telegram supplies
    none — and stored on the row when it is there, which is what lets a later
    ``message_deleted`` event find the message to redact. It also becomes a
    second deduplication line under the conditional unique constraint on
    ``(channel_connection, provider_message_id)``.

``private_reply_claimed`` on a **comment** event
    See the comment row of the table above.

    1. **The ladder only moves forward.** ``queued -> sent -> delivered -> read``.
       Platforms do not promise receipt ordering — Meta routinely sends them out
       of order — and a late "sent" must not un-read a message an agent can see
       was read.
    2. **``failed`` is only written over ``queued`` or ``sent``.** A failure
       receipt for a message the platform already reported delivered is a stale
       retransmission, and acting on it tells an operator that a delivered
       message failed.
    3. **A delivery receipt beats ``failed``.** Arriving is stronger evidence
       than a send-time error, and PR 2's retry path must not re-send something
       that actually landed.
    4. **A message that has stepped off the ladder never rejoins it.**
       ``deleted`` is not a rung (:data:`DELIVERY_PROGRESS` omits it on
       purpose), so a receipt for a redacted message moves nothing.

    Rule 4 is a lookup, not a policy, and it used to be neither: ``current`` was
    subscripted directly, so a receipt arriving for a ``deleted`` message raised
    ``KeyError`` from a function whose whole job is to be a pure, total decision
    table. Inside ``persist_events`` that was swallowed by the batch's broad
    ``except``; :func:`apply_receipt`'s other caller — issue #26's ``/o/`` open
    pixel — has no such net, so the same row turned an unauthenticated request
