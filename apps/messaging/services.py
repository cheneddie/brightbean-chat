"""The messaging service facade — ROADMAP contract 1.

    L3-B's nodes and L4-D's inbox mutate messaging state **only** through this
    facade.

So the signatures here are load-bearing: two workstreams are written against
them without reading this file, and ``tests/test_facade_contract.py`` pins them
so a rename breaks in this tree rather than in theirs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
send_outbound, in the order SPEC §9.4 fixes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. conversation for (contact, connection);
2. identity — missing means a ``failed`` row with ``no_identity``, not a raise;
3. :func:`~apps.messaging.compliance.can_send` — a denial is a ``failed`` row
   carrying a machine-readable code;
4. **insert the message row before the provider call**, and let an
   idempotency-key conflict mean "somebody else owns this send";
5. an agent send pauses automation;
6. a token from the connection's bucket;
7. the adapter;
8. record what happened.

**It never raises.** SPEC §9.5 says a failed send follows the ``default`` edge
onward rather than killing the flow, and a function that raised from the retry
handler but not inline would be two behaviours wearing one name. Every failure
comes back as a ``Message`` whose ``status`` and ``error`` say what went wrong.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two guards, because the unique key alone is not enough
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The unique index on ``(conversation, idempotency_key)`` stops a *second row*.
It does not by itself stop a second **provider call**: a thousand callers racing
on one key all block on the index, then all read back the same ``queued`` row,
and a naive implementation would have all of them send. So the row insert
answers "who owns this message" and a separate compare-and-set on
``dispatched_at`` answers "who owns this attempt". Only the winner of the second
one calls the adapter.

``dispatched_at`` doubles as SPEC §9.4's unknown-outcome signal: set with an
empty ``provider_message_id`` means the call went out and we never learned the
result, which is the only state where a re-send carries duplicate risk — and the
only state :mod:`apps.messaging.lookup` is consulted for.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What a caller has to have committed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing here opens a transaction around the provider call, so at the top level
the message row is committed before the adapter is touched and a crash mid-call
leaves a ``queued`` row a retry can find. Called from inside an open transaction
— the worker's handler, or L3-B's runner under its contact lock — the nested
``atomic()`` is a savepoint rather than a commit, and that window widens to the
caller's transaction. That is the same window SPEC §9.4 already describes and
accepts; closing it entirely needs a second database connection, which is a
change to how this app talks to Postgres and is not one to make for a
hypothetical.

    (that upgrade lives in :func:`_identity_for`, because "first send" is when a

    """A reply the law requires us to send, exempt from opt-out suppression only.

    The one sanctioned way past :func:`~apps.messaging.compliance.can_send`, and
    it exists because the alternative is worse. SPEC §6.6 requires an SMS
    ``STOP`` to be answered with a confirmation and a ``HELP`` to be answered at
    all — both after the identity is already suppressed, and both are carrier
    obligations rather than messages anybody chose to send. Without a door here
    an adapter would have to call ``adapter.send`` itself, and the confirmation
    would then have no message row, no idempotency key and no rate token: an
    agent looking at the thread would see ``HELP`` and no answer.

    **Exempt from the compliance verdict, and from nothing else.** The
    conversation, the message row, SPEC §9.4's idempotency key, the connection's
    token bucket, the tombstone check on a deleted contact and the adapter
    dispatch are all the ordinary path — this function is ``send_outbound``
    minus one call. In particular a send with no identity still fails with
    ``no_identity``: there is no address to answer, and being mandatory does not
    conjure one.

    It carries **no platform knowledge**, deliberately. Contract 4's promise is
    that a Layer-5 platform costs one module and one registry line, and a branch
    in here naming SMS would be the first crack in it. What makes a reply
    mandatory is the caller's business; L5-E's unsubscribe confirmation is the
    next one through this door.

    ``source`` is fixed to ``automation``. SPEC §5 fixes the vocabulary at
    ``automation, agent, api, broadcast, sequence`` and none of them means
    "the law made us", so the closest true one is used rather than a sixth value
    invented here. It emphatically must not be ``agent``: that would pause
    automation on the conversation for thirty minutes because somebody typed
    STOP, and nobody has taken anything over.

    The other end of contract 1 from :func:`send_outbound`. Some work that
    produced a message can be cancelled after the row exists — a broadcast
    stopped mid-fanout, a sequence unsubscribed while a step waits on the token
    bucket — and until this existed the caller could cancel the ``send_retry``
    but had no way to say so on the message. What it left behind is the exact
    state :func:`_defer` calls out: ``queued`` with nothing scheduled to move it,
    stuck forever, with an operator staring at the wrong status.

    **Compare-and-set, on ``queued`` and an unset ``dispatched_at``.** Not a
    read-then-save: ``dispatched_at`` is what :func:`_claim` grants, so a message
    the adapter has already been handed is one whose outcome belongs to whoever
    holds that claim, and a retraction that overwrote it would replace a real
    send with a fiction — including SPEC §9.4's unknown outcome, the one state
    where the platform may well have the message. Losing the race is not an
    error and not a raise: the message comes back with whatever status the
    winner wrote, which is the truth about it. Callers that need to know can
    compare ``status``.

    ``reason`` is the caller's own machine-readable word for *why*, stored as
    ``withdrawn:<reason>`` in the same shape as :func:`_code` — the code before
    the colon is what ``codes.describe()`` renders, so the detail costs an
    operator nothing and gives whoever is debugging the cancellation a thread to
    pull. It is required rather than defaulted because "cancelled by what?" is
    the only question a withdrawn row raises.

    The pending ``send_retry`` goes with it, and only once the compare-and-set
    has won — cancelling first would disarm the ladder under a send that is
    genuinely still in flight. The two cannot then disagree: the status is
    written before the action is cancelled, and ``handle_send_retry`` re-reads
    that status, so even a worker that claims the row in the window between them

    A scheduling error is not allowed to escape either. ``send_outbound``
