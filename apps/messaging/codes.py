"""The machine-readable codes an outbound message can carry.

``Message.error`` holds one of these and nothing else. A provider's own error
text routinely quotes the request that caused it — including an access token in
a query string — and this column is rendered in the inbox (SECURITY-BASELINE
§5), so the sentence a human reads is looked up from :data:`REASON_COPY` at
render time rather than stored per row. That is the same "registered copy, not
an f-string at the call site" shape ``apps.notifications.events`` uses.

Four vocabularies, kept apart because they answer different questions:

``Grant``   why a send was allowed — which is not decoration. ``human_agent``
            and ``tag_supplied`` are the difference between a compliant Meta
            send and one that can get a page disabled, and an operator asking
            "why did this go out?" is asking for exactly this word.
``Denial``  why compliance refused. Lands on the message row.
``Failure`` why the provider call did not produce a sent message.
``Limit``   why the organization's own plan refused. Optional: on a
            deployment with no billing configured nothing can produce one.

    **A fourth vocabulary rather than a new ``Denial`` member**, and the

    ``apps.messaging.compliance`` gives each of them a ``Q`` and a callable, and
    ``apps.broadcasts.audience`` compiles them into a ``Case``/``When`` over
    identity rows. A plan limit is not a per-identity predicate — it is a
    property of the organization — so a ``Denial`` member with no ``Q`` spelling
    would be a landmine for whoever next writes ``for code in Denial``.

    It is also the only vocabulary here that is **optional**: on a deployment
