"""The scheduled-action table: one row per unit of deferred work (SPEC §5, §15).

This is the whole scheduling substrate. SPEC §22 is absolute — no Redis, ever —
so every time-based behaviour in the product (flow delays, send retries,
sequence steps, broadcast fanout, followup timers, outbound webhook deliveries,
housekeeping) is a row here that a worker claims, runs and marks terminal.

Two shapes of row live in this table and the difference is ``workspace``:

* **Tenant work** carries a workspace, like every other tenant table.
* **Deployment work** — the hourly ``housekeeping`` chain — carries ``NULL``.

That is why ``workspace`` is redeclared nullable below, and it is worth being
precise about why the nullable column is the *safe* option rather than a
loophole. ``WorkspaceScopedQuerySet.for_workspace()`` filters on a concrete id,
so a NULL-workspace row matches no tenant query that has ever been written: a
system row is reachable only from code that says ``.unscoped()`` out loud. The
alternative — a sentinel "System" workspace row — would put a fake tenant into
``apps.workspaces``, the workspace switcher and every listing that forgets to
filter it out.

    writes the value into the column, and :mod:`apps.queueing.locks` hashes the
    same value into the advisory-lock key the whole engine serialises on
    (SPEC §9.6). If those two ever normalised differently — one keeping

    under exactly the concurrency it exists for.
