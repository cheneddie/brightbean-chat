"""The handler registry and the enqueue helper — the queue's public API.

Everything above Layer 2 that wants deferred work touches exactly two names
from this module: :func:`register_handler` to say what a type *does*, and
:func:`schedule` to put a row in the table. Neither requires editing this app,
which is the point — the queue is substrate, and the features that ride on it
arrive later and independently.

**How a later layer registers.** Put the handlers in your own app's
``handlers.py`` and import it from your ``AppConfig.ready()`` so registration is
an import side effect::

    # apps/flows/handlers.py
    from apps.queueing.registry import register_handler

    @register_handler("resume_execution")
    def resume_execution(payload, action):
        ...

    # apps/flows/apps.py
    class FlowsConfig(AppConfig):
        def ready(self):
            from apps.flows import handlers  # noqa: F401

Never add a branch to this module for your type, and never edit another app's
handler: the registry is additive by construction, and a duplicate registration
raises rather than silently replacing (two apps quietly claiming one type is a
bug that would otherwise surface as work running under the wrong code).

**The handler contract.** ``handler(payload, action) -> None``, called inside a
transaction that already holds the contact advisory lock when the row names a
contact (SPEC §9.6). Raise to retry: the worker rolls the transaction back and
reschedules with the SPEC §15 backoff. Return normally to mark the row done.
A handler must be safe to run more than once — a worker can die between the
handler committing and the row being marked, and zombie recovery will re-run it.

    The erasure-side counterpart to :func:`cancel_pending`, and a *delete* where
    that one is an update, because the two answer different questions.
    Cancelling disarms the work; issue #29's GDPR erasure has to remove the row
    itself. ``ScheduledAction.contact_id`` is a plain ``UUIDField`` and not a
    foreign key (see the column's comment), so nothing cascades it — and both
    ``payload`` and ``last_error`` can quote a message body, a rendered
    template or an address. A cancelled row is a row that still holds the text.

    **``running`` rows are left alone, and counted.** A worker that already
    claimed a row finishes by writing to it, and deleting it underneath would
    turn its ``update_fields`` save into "did not affect any rows" — a loud
    failure in an unrelated handler.

    Holding :func:`~apps.queueing.locks.contact_lock` does **not** make that set
    empty, which is the part worth being precise about. The lock stops a *new*
    handler for this contact starting; it says nothing about a row a worker
    marked ``running`` before its process died, which stays ``running`` until
    the zombie sweep resets it ten minutes later. Such a row survives the
    erasure holding whatever its payload held, so the count comes back in
    :attr:`PurgeResult.left_running` for the caller to record. Reporting a
    clean sweep that did not happen is the failure this return type exists to
    prevent.

    ``exclude_action_id`` spares one row by primary key. On the queued path the
    RUNNING exclusion above already spares the erasure's own action — the
    worker marks it ``running`` before dispatching — so this is the guard for a
    caller that is *not* the worker, and for the day the RUNNING rule changes.
    It is proven independently by ``apps/queueing/tests/test_registry.py``
    rather than resting on the exclusion that currently shadows it.

    **The column is not the only place a contact id lives**, which is why the
    predicate is a pair. ``apps.api.delivery.enqueue_delivery`` deliberately
    leaves ``contact_id`` null — a contact-bearing row runs under that contact's
    advisory lock, and holding it across a ten-second call to somebody else's
    server would stall every message for that contact behind a slow receiver —
    and puts the id in ``payload["data"]["contact_id"]`` instead. Matching only
    the column would leave a queued outbound webhook that fires *after* the
    erasure, announcing an event naming a contact this deployment has promised
    to have forgotten. That is the one delivery a subject-access request would
    ask about.
