"""The hourly housekeeping chain and the registry other layers hang jobs off.

SPEC §15 lists what has to happen on a schedule: prune the webhook event log,
expire stale waiting executions, poll WhatsApp template statuses, reset zombies.
Only the last of those is this issue's work — every other item belongs to a
feature that has not landed yet. So what ships here is the *mechanism*: a
registry, a self-rescheduling action to drive it, and one job.

**How a later layer adds a job.** Same shape as the handler registry —
registration is an import side effect of your own app's ``ready()``::

    # apps/channels/housekeeping.py
    from apps.queueing.housekeeping import register_housekeeping_job

    @register_housekeeping_job("prune_webhook_event_log")
    def prune_webhook_event_log() -> str | None:
        ...
        return f"pruned {count} rows"       # returned text is logged

A job takes no arguments, runs across every tenant (that is what housekeeping
*is*), and must be idempotent: the sweep retries as a whole if any job fails,
so a job that already succeeded will run again.

**Why the chain cannot break.** The handler schedules its successor *before* it
runs anything. A sweep that throws still leaves next hour's row in the table, so
one bad hour cannot silently end all future housekeeping — which, since zombie
recovery is itself a housekeeping job, would otherwise be an outage that hides
itself. Per-hour idempotency keys mean two workers, a tick and a restart all
converge on the same single row.

The chain rides on a NULL-workspace ``ScheduledAction`` (see
``apps.queueing.models``): housekeeping belongs to the deployment, not to a
tenant, and a NULL workspace is invisible to every ``.for_workspace()`` query.
