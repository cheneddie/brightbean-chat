"""Claiming, running and rescheduling actions — the worker's whole brain.

Every entry point shares this module: ``manage.py process_tasks`` loops over
:func:`run_batch`, ``manage.py tick`` and ``/internal/tick`` both call
:func:`drain`. There is one implementation of "what happens to a due row", so
the three cannot drift.

**Concurrency safety is structural, not conventional.** The claim keeps
SPEC §15's ``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` guarantee, but D9 adds one ordering
layer before the lock: due rows are ranked inside each workspace, then the
worker takes lane 1 across workspaces before lane 2, and so on. A workspace
with 10 000 older rows therefore cannot hide another workspace's ten due rows
behind 200 batches.

``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` still means two workers running the identical
statement at the identical moment select disjoint row sets — the second does
not block and does not see the first's rows. The ``UPDATE`` commits the ``running`` status
before any handler runs, so a third worker arriving a millisecond later sees no
``pending`` row to claim. No queue table lock, no leader election, no Redis
(SPEC §22). ``/internal/tick`` is therefore safe to fire while workers run, and
two workers plus a tick over the same backlog is a supported configuration, not
a race to be avoided.

**Crossing tenants is the point here.** ``ScheduledAction`` is a
``WorkspaceScopedModel``, and every *application* read of it must go through
``.for_workspace()``. The worker is the deliberate exception: it drains the
whole deployment, tenant rows and NULL-workspace system rows alike. The claim
runs through ``.raw()``, which is not a ``WorkspaceScopedQuerySet`` and so is
not guarded at all — that is why it lives in this one function, with this
comment, and why every other cross-tenant read in the app spells ``.unscoped()``
out loud (CONTRIBUTING.md, "``.unscoped()`` needs a comment saying why").
