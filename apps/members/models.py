"""Memberships and invitations.

Ported from BrightBean Studio's ``apps/members/models.py``. Roles, levels and
the permission matrix live in :mod:`apps.members.roles` (deviation 6); Studio's
``CustomRole`` is dropped entirely (deviation 5).

Fixes carried over the port:

* ``OrgMembership.accepted_at`` is actually written. Studio declares the column
  and never sets it, so "has this person accepted?" is unanswerable from the
  membership row.
* Indexes on the invitation lookups the service layer performs on every invite.

    ``/internal/tick``), where there is nothing to revoke.

    **What is stored is a digest, not the token.** The token is the whole
    credential — anyone holding it joins the organization, at whatever role the
    invitation names — so keeping it in a column would mean a database snapshot
    handed over every pending invitation, which is exactly what
    SECURITY-BASELINE §5 forbids. ``token_digest`` is a keyed HMAC
